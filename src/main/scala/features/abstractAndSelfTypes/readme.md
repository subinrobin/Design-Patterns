**Use generics:**
* If you need just type instantiation; a good example is the standard collection classes
* If you are creating a family of types

**Use abstract types:**
* If you want to allow people to mix in types using traits
* If you need better readability in scenarios where both could be interchangeable
* If you want to hide the type definition from the client code
