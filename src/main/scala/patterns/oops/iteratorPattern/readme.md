The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interface, not implementations
* Strive for loosely couped designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.
* Talk only to your friends
* Don't call us, we'll call you
* A class should have only one reason to change
