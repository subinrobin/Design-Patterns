The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interface, not implementations
* Strive for loosely couped designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.
* Talk only to your friends
