The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log request, and support undoable operations.

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interface, not implementations
* Strive for loosely couped designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.
