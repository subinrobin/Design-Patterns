The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets sub-classes decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interface, not implementations
* Strive for loosely couped designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.
