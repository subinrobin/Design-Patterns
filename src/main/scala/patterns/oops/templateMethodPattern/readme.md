The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interface, not implementations
* Strive for loosely couped designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.
* Talk only to your friends
* Don't call us, we'll call you
