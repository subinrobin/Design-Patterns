Mediator design pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of other objects interact with each other in order to promote losse coupling and allow us to vary class interactions independently. Applicable for many to many relationships - permission groups in software, taxi systems, air traffic control systems...

**Good for**
1. Keeps coupling between classes losse in an application
2. achieve simplicity and maintainability, while still allowing to model complex interactions between objects

**Not Good for**
1. overtime mediators become complex and hard to understand
2. complexity increases with number of classes involved
